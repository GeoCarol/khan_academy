# Fruit Card Game

Imagine what the rules of Aiyanaâ€™s game might be and then build a one player version. 

Maybe a player chooses between two randomly drawn cards each turn, until they have ten cards. 

Use your scoring functions to see how the player did! Which fruit strategy would you choose?

## To Do 
Add a deck of cards and randomized draw card and draw hand funtions.
